Pluralization
*************

Plurals are essential when dealing with internationalization. LinguiJS_
uses `CLDR Plural Rules`_. In general, there are 6 plural forms (taken
from `CLDR Plurals`_ page):

- zero
- one (singular)
- two (dual)
- few (paucal)
- many (also used for fractions if they have a separate class)
- other (required—general plural form—also used if the language only has a single form)

Only the last one, *other*, is required because it's the only common plural form
used in all languages.

All other plural forms depends on language. For example English has only two:
*one* and *other* (1 book vs. 2 books). In Czech, we have three: *one*, *few*,
*many* (1 kniha, 2 knihy, 5 knih). Some languages have even more, like Russian
and Arabic.

Using plural forms
==================

Good thing is that **as developers, we have to know only plural forms for
the source language**.

If we use English in the source code, then we'll use only *one* and *other*:

.. code-block:: js

   i18n.plural({
     value: numBooks,
     one: "# book",
     other: "# books"
   })

When ``numBooks == 1``, this will render as *1 book* and for ``numBook == 2``
it will be *2 books*.

   Funny fact for non-english speakers: In English, 0 uses plural form too,
   *0 books*.

Under the hood, ``i18n.plural`` is replaced with low-level ``i18n._``. For production, the above example will become:

.. code-block:: js

   i18n._('{numBooks, plural, one {# book} other {# books}}', { numBooks })

When we extract messages from source code using :doc:`lingui-cli </tutorials/cli>`, we get:

.. code-block:: default

   {numBooks, plural, one {# book} other {# books}}

Now, we give it to our Czech translator and they'll translate it as:

.. code-block:: default

   {numBooks, plural, one {# kniha} few {# knihy} other {# knih}}

The important thing is that *we don't need to change our code to support
languages with different plural rules*. Here's a step-by-step description of
the process:

1. In source code, we have:

   .. code-block:: js

    i18n.plural({
       value: numBooks,
       one: "# book",
       other: "# books"
    })

2. Code is compiled to (using `lingui-js` or `lingui-react` babel preset):

   .. code-block:: js

      i18n._(
         '{numBooks, plural, one {# book} other {# books}}',
         { numBooks }
      )

3. Message `{numBooks, plural, one {# book} other {# books}}` is translated to:

   .. code-block:: default

      {numBooks, plural, one {# kniha} few {# knihy} other {# knih}}

4. Finally, message is formatted using Czech plural rules.

Using other language than English
=================================

That works perfectly fine! Just learn what `plural forms <http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/latest/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html>`_ your
languages has and then you can use them. Here's the example in Czech:

.. code-block:: js

   i18n.plural({
     value: numBooks,
     one: '# kniha',
     few: '# knihy',
     other: '# knih'
   })

This make LinguiJS_ useful also for unilingual projects, i.e: if you don't
translate your app at all. Plurals, number and date formatting are common in
every language.
